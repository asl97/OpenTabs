This is just a short summary of the changes, check the git log for the full logs.

- updateGroupList and renderGroupList was both async, leading to possible race condition
  renderGroupList is change to take an list of group instead of looking it up the group itself
  since the group is usually available when calling renderGroupList

- change storage of data into an object instead of an array
  using an array lead to lots of complex hard to follow code, especially relating to group storage
  changing it to an object simplify updating/removing/looking up by name
  the code already forbid same name so it should be fine

- allow theme to change font color when require
  add two simple solid color theme

- add a whole bunch of borders and background
  for theme, buttons and stuff so it look better

- rewrite a number of poorly implemented functions
  like compressTabs and promptIsOpen to directly return the object instead of doing it in a round about way

- reduce duplicate code
  reindent and restyle code

- rename option page to theme page
  allow editing of theme without needing to open the extension page

- new group ui in options
  allow removing links

- import and export function
